# find-dups, a tool to identify files with identical content

find-dups is a command line tool to find files with identical content across
two different directories.

I wrote this tool because I wanted to learn more about the Rust programming
language, so I picked a problem that I know how to solve in other languages.

This tool works for what I needed it to do. There are no plans for
improvement.
